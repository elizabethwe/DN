Why are some movements subject to rejection via status quo bias, while others overcome it and gain popularity?

Sometimes people are aware of social change, and actively resist it.

Status quo bias means that in adopting changes, potential losses loom larger than potential gains, which leads people to maintain the status quo.  

System justification motivates people to hold a positive view of the institutions (social, economic, political) that are intertwined in their lives.

Social influence can lead people to infer that the status quo is efficient, competent, socially approved, enjoyable, etc.

Social changes that are compatible with the values of the dominant system may be more tolerable and overcome status quo bias.
