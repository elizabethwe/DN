Why are some movements subject to rejection via status quo bias, while others overcome it and gain popularity?

Sometimes people are aware of social change, and actively resist it.

Social influence can lead people to infer that the status quo is efficient, competent, socially approved, enjoyable, etc.

Social changes that are compatible with the values of the dominant system may be more tolerable and overcome status quo bias.
